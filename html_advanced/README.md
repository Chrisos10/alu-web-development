# Creating A school webpage from a designer file

For this project, the focus is on pure HTML semantics. The idea is to dvelop a webpage basing on the figma file that can be found on this figma page, "https://www.figma.com/file/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=dukKQARgjRq1kxhW-0". To Access the assents and more details about the wwebpage, make sure to click on  "Duplicate to your drafts" that can be found on the homepage options in the middle of the interface.
